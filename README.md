# Road_Segmemtation



# Running FCNs code in Colab

# Try to get output from the FCN and U-NETS and also try other models also. 



This repo contains the road segemntation from a high qulaity image using the various models, techniques and algorithms.

Approaches:

1. A fully loaded U-nets network.
2. Pretrained Encoder and Decoder Netwrok Part. COMPLETED link: - https://github.com/JunshengFu/semantic_segmentation <br>
3. If time permits try out various models which are used here: https://github.com/JunHyeok96/Road-Segmentation
4. Also look at the papers metioned in them
